description: The third course project was a grpup project, built in a week by myself and three others during the WDI course at GA. Working in a team carried a new challenge, but one I thrived on. We set out to create a dynamic web application with a solid back-end api that we felt demonstrated a real business/revenue mindset. Tech used includes Node, MongoDB, Jquery, Ajax, Semantic UI.
